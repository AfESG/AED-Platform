    Data Access and Release Policy of the African Elephant Database
    ===============================================================

    Introduction
    ------------

    The African Elephant Database (AED) of the IUCN/SSC African Elephant
    Specialist Group (AfESG) aims to provide an accurate and objective
    continent-wide picture on the status and distribution of the African
    elephant, and thus help in developing long-term management and
    conservation strategies for the species. Data entered into the African
    Elephant Database are obtained through the generous assistance of many
    governments, organizations and individuals from numerous elephant
    Range States throughout sub-Saharan Africa.

    The African Elephant Database comprises a number of distinct components:

    *   A set of electronic maps of areas where information on elephant
        numbers has been collected throughout the years. These maps are
        linked to database tables giving information on the types and
        results of surveys, reliability, and other relevant factors.
    *   A set of electronic maps depicting elephant distribution. Some of
        the areas depicted in the distribution maps have been formally
        surveyed, whereas others have not. Distribution maps are linked
        to database tables which give additional information about the
        nature and reliability of range information.
    *   Additional electronic maps depicting ancillary information, such
        as protected areas, national boundaries, roads, rivers and relief.
        Most of these ancillary maps have been obtained from third-party
        providers and do not belong to the AfESG.
    *   Supporting documentation for the electronic database.
    *   Data in the AED are subject to extensive review by the Data Review
        Working Group (DRWG) of the AfESG. In addition, digitized data
        undergo stringent validation and verification procedures as they
        are entered into the AED. These processes lead to the preparation
        and publication of periodic “status reports,” which summarize
        verified information in the full database and which aim to
        provide the best interpretation of available data.
    *   At any time between the publication of status reports, the
        electronic version of the AED is a 'work in progress' and may
        therefore include contradictory and/or unverified information.

    Objectives and General Policy Statement
    ---------------------------------------

    The primary objective of this policy is to make the AED as freely and
    widely available as possible, while encouraging users of AED data to
    take account of the limitations of the data in their analyses. It is
    also the duty of AfESG, and an objective of this policy, to ensure that:

    *   AED data are used for the benefit of elephant conservation in Africa.
    *   The wishes of providers of source information who have placed express
        restrictions on the dissemination of their raw data are respected.
    *   Any agreements with providers of ancillary GIS information are respected.
    *   The integrity of the database is maintained by discouraging the
        circulation of multiple modified versions.
    *   It is the belief of the AfESG that the above objectives can best be
        achieved with the following broad policies:

        -   Hard copy and 'read-only' electronic versions of the AED are freely
            available: electronic Status Report can be downloaded from the
            Internet, and the printed version is available on request, subject
            to logistic and financial constraints.
        -   Full or partial, editable versions of the updated electronic
            database will be made available on a controlled basis, with
            conditions designed to restrict the dissemination of altered
            versions and of ancillary data layers that are not the property
            of AfESG, and to encourage people analyzing the data to take
            account of its limitations.
        -   Unless Data Providers have placed restrictions on the circulation
            of source data, such data will be made available for inspection
            upon request, subject to logistic and financial constraints.

    *  The above points are for guidance only. The details of this policy
       are set out in the two sections that follow.

    Definitions
    -----------

    For the purposes of this policy, the following definitions shall apply:

    *African Elephant Database (AED)* - An electronic collection of tables,
    georeferenced maps and any other datasets, digitized by the African
    Elephant Specialist Group and containing information relating to
    elephant distribution and abundance in the Range States of African
    Elephants. Any data captured or digitized and integrated into the African
    Elephant Database and any views or extracts thereof remain the property
    of the African Elephant Specialist Group.

    *African Elephant Database Source Data* – The collection of reports,
    personal communications, questionnaire replies, publications and any
    other form of data or information submitted to the AfESG for input
    into the African Elephant Database.

    *African Elephant Status Report (AESR)* – Any of the reports on the
    status and distribution of African elephants produced by the IUCN/SSC
    African Elephant Specialist Group (generally every three years) in hard
    copy and/or read-only electronic format. African Elephant Status
    Reports, which have been in the past published under the name “African
    Elephant Database”, contain views from the African Elephant Database.

    *Ancillary Datasets* – A collection of tables and maps in digital format
    and views and extracts thereof produced by third parties and employed
    in the African Elephant Database.

    *Digital Data Extract* – A digital subset data contained in the African
    Elephant Database and/or related digital databases operated by the
    African Elephant Specialist Group in editable, tabular or graphic,
    geo-referenced format.

    *View* – A snapshot of a subset of data contained in the African
    Elephant Database and/or related digital databases operated by the
    African Elephant Specialist Group, in a non-georeferenced, rasterized
    or non-editable electronic vector format, or in hard copy.

    Access to Data from the African Elephant Database
    -------------------------------------------------

    Digital data will be made available to African Elephant Specialist Group
    (AfESG) members on request, and may be made available to other groups or
    individuals provided the conditions detailed below are satisfied.

    1.  *Access to AED Status Reports.*
        For the purpose of data release and access, AED Status Reports and any
        data views contained therein are in the public domain once they have
        been published in hard copy or released in read-only electronic format
        on the official AfESG Internet web site. Access to AED Status Reports
        is subject to availability. Dissemination of altered hard copy or
        electronic AED Status Reports by third parties is not permitted.
    2.  *Access to Views from the African Elephant Database.*
        Views of the database depicting processed summary tables or maps in
        non geo-referenced, bitmapped or non-editable vector graphic formats
        may be made available upon written request, subject to resource constraints.
    3.  *Access to Digital Data Extracts from the African Elephant Database.*
        The release of digital Data Extracts from the African Elephant Database

            from the AED must submit a proposal to the AfESG Data Review Working
            Group (DRWG), outlining how the database is to be used and why the
            data are required in digital form. Digital data will be released if
            the DRWG considers the release not to violate existing agreements with
            data providers, the intended use is not anticipated to be detrimental
            to elephant conservation and takes account of the limitations of
            data quality.
        2.  The authors, prior to submission, publication or dissemination of
            any output containing any views, alterations, manipulations or
            analysis of digital data extracted from the African Elephant Database,
            must submit to the DRWG, for review and comment, a final draft of all
            materials intended for dissemination.
        3.  Any alteration to digital data supplied by the AED and intended
            for publication, dissemination or placement in the public domain,
            must be accompanied by a statement by the author(s), clearly
            describing the nature of any alterations effected on data extracted
            from the African Elephant Database. The author(s) must also submit
            to the Data Review Working Group the altered dataset in its entirety
            for review, and grant express permission to the AfESG for possible
            integration of the altered data into the African Elephant Database,
            subject to review and acceptance by the DRWG.
        4.  Digital Data Extracts released to any person or group will
            remain the property of the AfESG and will not be passed on to any
            third party
        5.  Any AED data used in papers, reports, publications or any other
            output will be given proper acknowledgement, which will be stipulated
            in the users agreement (see number 7).
        6.  The AfESG secretariat must be provided with 2 copies of any
            document or output in which data from the AED is used.
        7.  An agreement to the standard terms and conditions above must be
            signed and returned to the AfESG Secretariat before any data will be
            released. Such an agreement will include points 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
            listed above.

    4.  *Access to Source Data.* As a custodian of AED Source Data,
