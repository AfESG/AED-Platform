    | ElephantDatabase.org is the online home of the African and Asian Elephant Database, a joint project of the
    | IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) and Asian Elephant Specialist Group (AsESG).

    | ElephantDatabase.org presents data from past African Elephant Status Reports, as well as the latest
    | survey data reported to either specialist group.  Data on this web site is made available under a
    | [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)
    | license.

    | Past African Elephant Status Reports, including a large amount of narrative information, are available
    | in PDF format from [the AfESG web site](http://african-elephant.org)

    | Getting Involved
    ----------------

    | ElephantDatabase.org is an Open Source software project.  Every aspect of the database is powered by
    | free and open source software.  We are especially thankful for
    | [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org"),
    | [PostGIS](http://postgis.refractions.net),
    | and the open source tools that make them possible.

    | We also would like to thank [Google Fusion Tables](http://google.com/fusiontables) for serving up
    | simple and free visualizations of our geospatial data.

    | The African and Asian Elephant Specialist Groups are volunteer organizations, and this site and its
    | software systems are maintained principally by volunteers.  We have an ambitious roadmap, and need
    | your help to continue to grow.  Join us on [Assembla](http://www.assembla.com/spaces/aaed).
