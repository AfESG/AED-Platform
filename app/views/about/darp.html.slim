    | Introduction
  p
    | The African Elephant Database (AED) of the IUCN/SSC African Elephant
    | Specialist Group (AfESG) aims to provide an accurate and objective
    | continent-wide picture on the status and distribution of the African
    | elephant, and thus help in developing long-term management and
    | conservation strategies for the species. Data entered into the African
    | Elephant Database are obtained through the generous assistance of many
    | governments, organizations and individuals from numerous elephant
    | Range States throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
  p
    | The African Elephant Database comprises a number of distinct components:
  ul
    li
      | A set of electronic maps of areas where information on elephant
      | numbers has been collected throughout the years. These maps are
      | linked to database tables giving information on the types and
      | results of surveys, reliability, and other relevant factors.
    li
      | A set of electronic maps depicting elephant distribution. Some of
      | the areas depicted in the distribution maps have been formally
      | surveyed, whereas others have not. Distribution maps are linked
      | to database tables which give additional information about the
      | nature and reliability of range information.
    li
      | Additional electronic maps depicting ancillary information, such
      | as protected areas, national boundaries, roads, rivers and relief.
      | Most of these ancillary maps have been obtained from third-party
      | providers and do not belong to the AfESG.
    li
      | Supporting documentation for the electronic database.
    li
      | Data in the AED are subject to extensive review by the Data Review
      | Working Group (DRWG) of the AfESG. In addition, digitized data
      | undergo stringent validation and verification procedures as they
      | are entered into the AED. These processes lead to the preparation
      | and publication of periodic “status reports,” which summarize
      | verified information in the full database and which aim to
      | provide the best interpretation of available data.
    li
      | At any time between the publication of status reports, the
      | electronic version of the AED is a 'work in progress' and may
      | therefore include contradictory and/or unverified information.
  h2
    | Objectives and General Policy Statement
  p
    | The primary objective of this policy is to make the AED as freely and
    | widely available as possible, while encouraging users of AED data to
    | take account of the limitations of the data in their analyses. It is
    | also the duty of AfESG, and an objective of this policy, to ensure that:
  ul
    li
      | AED data are used for the benefit of elephant conservation in Africa.
    li
      | The wishes of providers of source information who have placed express
      | restrictions on the dissemination of their raw data are respected.
    li
      | Any agreements with providers of ancillary GIS information are respected.
    li
      | The integrity of the database is maintained by discouraging the
      | circulation of multiple modified versions.
    li
      | It is the belief of the AfESG that the above objectives can best be
      | achieved with the following broad policies:
      ul
        li
          | Hard copy and 'read-only' electronic versions of the AED are freely
          | available: electronic Status Report can be downloaded from the
          | Internet, and the printed version is available on request, subject
          | to logistic and financial constraints.
        li
          | Full or partial, editable versions of the updated electronic
          | database will be made available on a controlled basis, with
          | conditions designed to restrict the dissemination of altered
          | versions and of ancillary data layers that are not the property
          | of AfESG, and to encourage people analyzing the data to take
          | account of its limitations.
        li
          | Unless Data Providers have placed restrictions on the circulation
          | of source data, such data will be made available for inspection
          | upon request, subject to logistic and financial constraints.
    li
      | The above points are for guidance only. The details of this policy
      | are set out in the two sections that follow.
  h2
    | Definitions

      | Elephant Specialist Group and containing information relating to
      | elephant distribution and abundance in the Range States of African
      | Elephants. Any data captured or digitized and integrated into the African
      | Elephant Database and any views or extracts thereof remain the property

    | individuals provided the conditions detailed below are satisfied.
  ol
    li
      | <i>Access to AED Status Reports.</i
      | For the purpose of data release and access, AED Status Reports and any
      | data views contained therein are in the public domain once they have
      | been published in hard copy or released in read-only electronic format
      | on the official AfESG Internet web site. Access to AED Status Reports
      | is subject to availability. Dissemination of altered hard copy or
      | electronic AED Status Reports by third parties is not permitted.
    li
      | <i>Access to Views from the African Elephant Database.</i
      | Views of the database depicting processed summary tables or maps in
      | non geo-referenced, bitmapped or non-editable vector graphic formats

        | Group (DRWG), outlining how the database is to be used and why the
        | data are required in digital form. Digital data will be released if
        | the DRWG considers the release not to violate existing agreements with
        | data providers, the intended use is not anticipated to be detrimental
        | to elephant conservation and takes account of the limitations of
        | data quality.
      li
        | The authors, prior to submission, publication or dissemination of
        | any output containing any views, alterations, manipulations or
        | analysis of digital data extracted from the African Elephant Database,
        | must submit to the DRWG, for review and comment, a final draft of all
        | materials intended for dissemination.
