    | The 2007 African Elephant Status Report contained a number of errata.  These have been fixed in the display of data found on www.elephantdatabase.org, but for the purposes of clarity, they are briefly outlined below.

        | Cause of change for input zone
        em Tekezze Valley Wildlife Reserve
        | is ‘NA’, resulting in slightly adjusted numbers in the
        em Ethiopia Interpretation of Changes in Estimates from Previous Report
        | table (pages 77-78).
      li
        em Munyawama Game Reserve
        | was inadvertently omitted from the input zones in South Africa (page 146).  This has been rectified and slightly impacts the South Africa national-level totals (page 145), the Southern Africa regional-level totals (page 113), as well as the interpretation of changes at these three levels.
      li
        | An error in assignment of the cause of change for the Luiana East and West Partial Reserves (page 120) slightly impacts the interpretation of changes for Angola (page 119), Southern Africa (page 113) and the continent (page 23).
