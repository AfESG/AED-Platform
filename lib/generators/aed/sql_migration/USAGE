Description:
    Pass the name of an SQL file existing in script/etl/ and it will create a 
    migration that runs those sql files.

Example:
    rails generate aed:sql_migration MigrationName sql_file1.sql sql_file2.sql

    This will create:
        db/migrate/201604281234_migration_name.rb

    And will have two run_file methods calling both SQL files.

    A shortcut for when there only a single SQL file to run:

    rails generate aed:sql_migration sql_file.sql

    This will create:
       db/migrate/201604281234_sql_file.rb

    With a run_file method to call that single SQL file.
