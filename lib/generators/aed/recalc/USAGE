Description:
    Will create a new calculation folder based on today with a proper 
    migration file. From there, edit the files and run the migration

Example:
    rails generate aed:recalc name

    This will create:
        db/migrate/201604281234_{name}.rb

    And will have build_calculator methods for your calculation folders
