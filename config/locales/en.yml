        research:
          Outline below your proposed research, clearly describing how the data is to be used
          and why it is required in digital form. Please note that digital data will only be
          released if the Data Review Working Group (DRWG) of the African Elephant Specialist
          Group considers the release not violate existing agreements with data providers, the
          intended use is not anticipated to be detrimental to elephant conservation and takes
          account of the limitations of AED data quality.
