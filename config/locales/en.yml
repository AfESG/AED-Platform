    Currently we have extensive data on African elephants, and are beginning to introduce some Asian
    elephant data. Please explore our range data and population estimates using the map and tables below,

      precision of estimates and the proportion of assessed elephant range (i.e. range for which estimates are available).
      The IQI ranges from zero (no reliable information) to one (perfect information)."

      Count; EX: Extrapolation from GIS; GD: Genetic Dung Count; GS: Ground Sample Count; GT: Ground Total Count; IG:
      Informed Guess; IR: Individual Registration; OG: Other Guess. Survey Type is followed by an indicator of survey quality,

      of the importance and urgency for future population surveys. All areas of unassessed range have a priority
      of 1. See Introduction for details on how the PFS is derived."
    derived_warning:
      "Note that totals for the Definite, Probable, and Possible categories are derived by pooling the variances of
      individual estimates, as described at <a href='http://www.elephantdatabase.org/reliability'>
      http://www.elephantdatabase.org/reliability</a>. As a result, totals do not necessarily match the simple
